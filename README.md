## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/offthemenu/posterStormerDeployment.git
   cd poster-stormer
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - In the `.env` file, store the following variables:
     ```plaintext
     Mongo_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
    
     REACT_APP_FAL_KEY=<Your FAL API key>
     ```

### Running the App

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.embeddingsFetch:app --reload
   ```
   The backend server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start the React development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## How to Use

1. **Input a Prompt**: In the `PromptInput` section, type a description for your movie plot (i.e., one-paragraph synopsis) to inspire the poster generation.
2. **Select Additional Options (WiP)**: 
   - **Genre**: Choose a genre from the dropdown menu to filter similar movies by genre.
   - **Style**: Pick the artistic style you'd like your poster to be created with (e.g., "3D Digital Art").
   - **Make it Retro (Work in Progress)**: Toggle to give your poster an 80's feel
3. **Generate Posters**: Click the "Generate" button to view the poster based on the selected criteria.
4. **Navigate Posters**: Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to browse through the 3 generated posters.

## Design Choices

### App Purpose and Functionality

- **Primary Purpose**: The app enables users to generate movie posters based on a brief movie plot description.
- **Additional Features**: Users can expand the interface to add specific indicators like genre and style for a more customized poster generation experience.

### User Interface Layout

- **Simple Title and Plot Input (Left Panel)**: The primary input area where users type their movie plot. This minimal design choice focuses on simplicity, allowing users to directly enter the plot idea without distraction. There is also the option to edit the prompt for ease of use.
- **Advanced Options Dropdown**: Users have the option to expand for additional features, keeping the interface clean and npt overwhelming for basic use but allowing advanced customization for users who want more control over the output.
  - **Genre (Dropdown)**: Users can select a genre for the poster, offering genre-specific aesthetic influences on the poster's design. A dropdown allows the app to be more precise in the output as it gives the product more control.
  - **Style**: Allows users to specify the artistic style they want their posters to be created in. 
  - **Make it Retro**: This toggle button allows users to choose if they'd like their posters to be created with the 80's feel

## Backend API

The backend for Poster Stormer is built using **FastAPI** and provides endpoints to handle prompt generation, filtering movies based on user inputs, and retrieving available genres. The backend integrates with MongoDB for data storage and utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity searches.

---

### Overview

The backend consists of the following key components:
1. **Database Connection**: MongoDB is used to store movie details, embeddings, and user inputs.
2. **FAISS**: Used to perform similarity searches on movie embeddings.
3. **SentenceTransformer**: Embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert plots into vector representations for similarity calculations.
4. **Endpoints**: Includes APIs for generating prompts and retrieving genres.

### Features and Logic

#### 1. MongoDB Integration

- **Collections:**
  - **movieDetails:** Stores movie metadata (e.g., title, director, genre, release date).
  - **movieEmbeddings:** Stores precomputed embeddings for movie plots and their corresponding IMDb IDs.
  - **userInputCollection:** Stores user queries and generated prompts for tracking and debugging.

#### 2. FAISS Similarity Search

- Converts user-provided plot descriptions into embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`.
- Performs similarity search on the precomputed embeddings stored in `movieEmbeddings` to find the top 5 closest movies.

#### 3. Query Filtering

- Filters movies by:
  - **Genre:** Matches the genre specified by the user.
  - **Style:** Matches the poster style to predefined tags (e.g., "3D Digital Art").
  - **Retro Period:** Limits results to movies released between 1970-1989 if `isRetro` is set to true.

---

### Example Workflow

1. **User Inputs:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Last Voyage",
  "plot": "A journey to the unknown depths of the sea.",
  "genre": "Adventure",
  "style": "Realistic Photography",
  "isRetro": false
}
```

2. **Backend:**
   - Filters movies based on genre and retrieves precomputed embeddings.
   - Matches the plot embedding with the top 5 similar movies using FAISS.
   - Generates a descriptive prompt for the poster.

3. **Response:**

```json
{
  "imdbIDs": ["tt9876543", "tt8765432", "tt7654321", "tt6543210", "tt5432109"],
