Website Link and Deployment Mechanism:
The website is deployed at . Our team used Google Cloud Run for deployment, leveraging containerized services for seamless scalability and integration of the frontend (React app served via Nginx) and backend (FastAPI application).

Addressing User Needs Beyond the Classroom:
As our application expands to a broader audience, especially professional graphic designers and creative teams in film production, it's essential to adapt and ensure it meets the needs of diverse users. Here’s how we plan to achieve this:

Tailored User Profiles and Feedback Integration:
We will implement customizable user profiles where designers can specify their preferred genres, design styles, and other preferences. By aggregating and analyzing this data, we can refine the recommendations to align more closely with their creative workflows. Beyond just collecting feedback, we will introduce iterative updates where user suggestions directly influence future features.

Collaborative Design Features:
Recognizing that design often involves teamwork, we aim to integrate collaborative features like shared project folders, the ability to compare multiple poster ideas in a single interface, and team voting mechanisms. This will cater to the varying workflows of independent designers and larger studio teams.

Industry-Relevant Enhancements:
To address professional needs, we’ll add features such as high-resolution downloads, poster layouts with placeholders for text and logos, and a library of design elements frequently used in the film industry. Designers working on tight schedules will benefit from these ready-to-use resources.

Inclusive Dataset Expansion:
Our current movie database may reflect biases toward Western or mainstream cinema. By partnering with international film databases and diversifying poster styles (e.g., Bollywood, anime, Nollywood), we can ensure relevance to designers working on non-Western or niche films.

Real-World Testing with Diverse User Groups:
We'll collaborate with film schools, small production studios, and independent designers for beta testing. These diverse demographics will help uncover unique needs and challenges, ensuring the application is universally valuable, not just for large studio teams.

Educational Resources for New Designers:
To accommodate users with varying levels of experience, especially entry-level designers, we plan to add resources like video tutorials, design tips, and explanations of how certain poster styles resonate with audiences. This will bridge the gap between seasoned professionals and those new to the field.

By prioritizing these initiatives, we aim to transform the application into a comprehensive tool that enhances creativity and efficiency, regardless of the user’s background or location.
